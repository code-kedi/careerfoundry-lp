## Thoughts on improvements

User Experience
* implement an easier way for users to select a course (at the moment, they need to make two clicks)
* add JS animations, further content to make the landing page more engaging
* make landing page responsive

Code-wise
* implement error handling
* implement automated testing
* refactor code based on best practices, e.g. Airbnb JS Style Guide
